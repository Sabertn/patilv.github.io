<h1>Welcome! </h1>
This site was initially hosted on the <a href="http://analyticsandvisualization.blogspot.com">blogger platform</a> and is now being migrated on to a Jekyll/GitHub platform. The purpose of this site is three-fold.

<ol>
<li> To provide a venue to me to comment on issues that I find important, such as healthcare, crime, poverty, business/economics, and education. In these comments, I use a data-driven approach (primarily using R) to highlight a specific issue.
<li> To provide a good blogging platform. My reason for switching from blogger was that it was not connected with my work-flow for the production of blog posts. Given that my work now involves writing in R markdown, I am hoping this serves me well.
<li> Provide a listing of technical resources to people interested in R and other packages that I have found useful.
</ol>
