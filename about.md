I am an Associate Professor of Marketing at [Gonzaga University](www.gonzaga.edu), where I teach or have taught courses in marketing, marketing research, multivariate statistics and business analytics. With my introduction to *R* in early 2013, that has become my go-to tool for any analysis. Prior to that, I used SPSS and SAS. Blogging, most of which has happened on the [blogger platform](www.analyticsandvisualization.blogspot.com), has also affected my writing, which has become more frequent. I am huge fan of the IDE from [RStudio](www.rstudio.com). Not a day goes by without it being fired up for either analysis or documentation.

Most of my schooling prior to my undergraduate study was from [D.A.V Senior Secondary School](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.A.V._Boys_Senior_Secondary_School) in Gopalapuram, Chennai. Interestingly, the school does not have a web page, yet. (Or if it is there, I couldn't find it.) The link is to a description on Wikipedia.
