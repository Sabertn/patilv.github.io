[The Lilac Bloomsday Run](http://bloomsdayrun.org/) is a 7.46 miles (12 kms) race held annually in Spokane, Washington. The run was started in 1977 by [Don Kardong](http://www.distancerunning.com/inductees/2005/kardong.html) and it saw 51,613 people register for it in 2013. In this post, I use R to collect data from their website, clean and organize them, and present some information about the run and its history using graphs generated using ggplot2. The markdown file with the code and output [can be found here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56796392/Bloomsday/BloomsdayMarkdownDocument.html). The code by itself, along with the raw data files to [replicate everything can be found on github](https://github.com/patilv/Bloomsdayrun). A pdf document with all pages from their website relevant for these graphs can [be found here.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56796392/Bloomsday/DatafromBloomsdaySite-AllGraphsInfo.pdf)
