This post is my slidify-based presentation on `dplyr`, a package that provides tools for data manipulation. The idea for this came from a [tutorial created by Kevin Markham](http://www.dataschool.io/dplyr-tutorial-for-faster-data-manipulation-in-r/) on this package. After a link to [my first presentation on this](http://patilv.com/dplyrtutorial) based on a dataset used in that tutorial (which is also used in [R-studio's introduction to dplyr](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) went on twitter, [Hadley Wickham suggested](https://twitter.com/vivekhpatil/status/515881508452564994) a revision using different datasets from package `nycflights13`, flights that departed NYC in 2013. The following was created in response to his feedback. The link to the code for anyone to tweak can be found in [my GitHub account](https://github.com/patilv/dplyr-nycflights).
