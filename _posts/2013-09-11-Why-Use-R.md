Update: Ramnath, thanks for the fix for the error from rawgithub.

This was a presentation made to few of my colleagues. The idea was to provide a brief introduction to R, provide few reasons for my switching to it, and give some samples of graphics/interactive visualizations that could be created with minimal coding. Slidify (impressjs framework) was used for putting the presentation together (the coding is imperfect) and the graphs/charts used ggplot2, rCharts, corrplot, healthvis, and PerformanceAnalytics libraries.
